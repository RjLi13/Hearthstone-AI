This is a Heartstone AI bot built with the help of Hackers@Berkeley and a dropbox member. It can automatically play a game of Hearthstone. Although it might lose quite often. This is made with the Python language and Skuli IDE. I learned how to use GUI applicable libraries in Python. To run, open Hearthstone and start a match. Then run the script and bot will start playing for you!

Note that this doesn't manipulate server or client code. It only controls the mouse, and frankly can't be used well, as it uses a brute force method. This was more to be meant of a showcase of scripting with Skuli
